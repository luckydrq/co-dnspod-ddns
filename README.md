co-dnspod-ddns
==============

Generator implemented ddns module for [dnspod](https://www.dnspod.cn) by `co` library

*NOTE: It can be run on any [node](http://nodejs.org) version that doesn't support generator thanks to [gnode](https://github.com/TooTallNate/gnode) and [regenerator](https://github.com/facebook/regenerator), just feel free to install.*

## Usage

For usage please refer another [repo](https://github.com/luckydrq/dnspod-ddns2) which is the same as this repo which is implemented with `promise` instead of `generator`.
